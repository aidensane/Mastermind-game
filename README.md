# Mastermind-game
This is a Python implementation of the classic Mastermind game.

# Rules
The game generates a secret code consisting of four colors chosen from a set of six possible colors. The player has 10 attempts to guess the code. After each guess, the player receives feedback indicating how many colors were correct and how many were in the correct position.

# How to Play
To play the game, run the script and follow the prompts to make guesses. The game will continue until the player either correctly guesses the code or runs out of attempts.
